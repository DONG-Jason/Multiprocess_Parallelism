# Python multiprocessing - Process-based parallelism
# The following scripts are written to demonstrate multiprocessing (Process-based parallelism) 
# using Python.
# Multiprocessing is a Python package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to 
# the threading module. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, 
# effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. 
# Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple 
# processors on a given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows.
# The multiprocessing module also introduces APIs which do not have analogs in the threading module. 
# A prime example of this is the Pool object which offers a convenient means of parallelizing the 
# execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes 
# (data parallelism). 
# This is a basic example of data parallelism using Pool,
 
from multiprocessing import Pool

def f(x):
    return x*x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Pool(5) as p:
        print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))
