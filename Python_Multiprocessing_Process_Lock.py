# Python multiprocessing - Process-based parallelism
# The following scripts are written to demonstrate multiprocessing (Process-based parallelism) 
# using Python.
# Multiprocessing is a Python package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to 
# the threading module. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, 
# effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. 
# Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple 
# processors on a given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows.
# The multiprocessing module also introduces APIs which do not have analogs in the threading module. 
# A prime example of this is the Pool object which offers a convenient means of parallelizing the 
# execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes 
# (data parallelism). 
# Apart from making the code (potentially) compatible with Windows and the other start methods this 
# also ensures that as long as the child process is still alive the object will not be garbage 
# collected in the parent process. This might be important if some resource is freed when the object 
# is garbage collected in the parent process.
 
from multiprocessing import Process, Lock

def f(l):
    ... do something using "l" ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    lock = Lock()
    for i in range(10):
        Process(target=f, args=(lock,)).start()
