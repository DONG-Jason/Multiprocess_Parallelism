# Python multiprocessing - Process-based parallelism
# The following scripts are written to demonstrate multiprocessing (Process-based parallelism) 
# using Python.
# Multiprocessing is a Python package that supports spawning processes using an API similar to 
# the threading module. The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, 
# effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. 
# Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple 
# processors on a given machine. It runs on both Unix and Windows.
# The multiprocessing module also introduces APIs which do not have analogs in the threading module. 
# A prime example of this is the Pool object which offers a convenient means of parallelizing the 
# execution of a function across multiple input values, distributing the input data across processes 
# (data parallelism). 
# Shared memory
# Data can be stored in a shared memory map using Value or Array.

        a[i] = -a[i]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num = Value('d', 0.0)
    arr = Array('i', range(10))

    p = Process(target=f, args=(num, arr))

    p.start()
    p.join()

    print(num.value)
    print(arr[:])
